# Price Card

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

I was required to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## Where to find coding

I have placed coding on a public repository [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

**Have fun coding!** ðŸš€
